# Personal User Manual 
## Marc Eric Wallner


## About me
* I am a jack-of-all-trades and a master of some
* My ability to work across the entire marketing stack is my USP
* My personality profile is: [INFJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality)
* I bring my whole self to work (we should chat about what that means for you, the organization, and me)

## How to contact me
* I am best contacted through Slack or any other messenger as it allows me time to provide the most helpful answer
(For instant communication) If I don’t reply fast, I reply well and vice versa
* For issues that need more attention, I prefer setting up dedicated meetings
* My schedule is open for everyone to see and book a slot
* I don’t mind being contacted outside of regular work hours, but I will likely only respond in the evenings
* I like a clear and simple narrative, based on what things look like in practice. This is the best way to get me to understand things 

## Preferred working style
* I work best as part of a small, fast-moving team of experts
* I thrive in work cultures that provide psychological safety to question the status quo
* I am most productive if I can kick around ideas openly with many individuals even when ideas are early stage
* I most enjoy working at a pace, with lots going on. Conversely, I lose energy in long-turnaround times/ extended deadlines where there is no sense of urgency

## Conditions I like to work in
* I find it hard to work in heated rooms; I enjoy plenty of fresh air and the option to work in rather cold temperatures
* I enjoy being able to work in both quiet and more open environments as both help me get certain things done more efficiently
* My own desk space is optional; I can work just fine with flexible seating arrangements

## What motivates me
* Hearing what others are working on to connect the dots for my work and the organization
* Organizations that know who they are and what they stand for
* A collective mission to work towards
* Transparency across hierarchies
* I thrive off challenging the status quo and get energy from thinking about how we could do things differently

## What demotivates me
* Lack of leadership
* Lack of shared vision and purpose
* Unnecessary processes, structures, and hierarchies 
* People holding back ideas, trying to perfect things, rather than engaging early for thoughts and feedback
* Favoritism and nepotism

## My values (and what I value in others)
* Collaboration
* Transparency
* Anti-territorial behavior
* Acting in the interest of common goals

## My blind spots
* I am less analytical than many other people and will rely on evidence and analysis from experts around me
* I genuinely want to know what people think, and I can sometimes take silence from people as a sign of a lack of interest

## My pet peeves
* Taking credit for the work of others
* Having a hidden agenda

## What people commonly misunderstand about me
* I often think while I speak. Some people find it easy to engage with this, others can mistake my unfinished thoughts for a rushed work approach
* When I challenge projects or ideas some may think I am challenging them personally. However, I don’t mean to. I am trying to make sure we are doing the right thing the right way 
* When I don’t experience transparency, I can worry about people having a hidden agenda
